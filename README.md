There exists already a big trove of literature on RI learning. Here I will explore it in practice. The "Banana" project is part of Udacity's "deep reinforcement learning" nanodegree. 

Some resources I used to start-up my knowledge:

[Unity](https://unity.com/) is a game engine that can be used to create three-dimensional, two-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality games, as well as simulations and other experiences. 

The Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit (ML-Agents) is an open-source Unity plugin that enables games and simulations to serve as environments for training intelligent agents. Agents can be trained using reinforcement learning, imitation learning, neuroevolution, or other machine learning methods through a simple-to-use Python API (https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). For more details see:

[Unity: A General Platform for Intelligent Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02627)

Part of the Unity ML-agent download is a selection of example learning environments, like the "Banana Collector":
